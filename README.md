## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Form Validation** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It checks user inputs (name, email, course selection) and shows a warning ⚠️ if any field is left empty.  
The form does not reload when validation fails, thanks to JavaScript’s `preventDefault()`.
